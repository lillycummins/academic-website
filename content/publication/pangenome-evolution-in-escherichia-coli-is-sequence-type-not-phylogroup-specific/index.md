abstract: The Escherichia coli species contains a diverse set of sequence types
  and there remain important questions regarding differences in genetic content
  within this population that need to be addressed. Pangenomes are useful
  vehicles for studying gene content within sequence types. Here, we analyse 21
  E. coli sequence type pangenomes using comparative pangenomics to identify
  variance in both pangenome structure and content. We present functional
  breakdowns of sequence type core genomes and identify sequence types that are
  enriched in metabolism, transcription and cell membrane biogenesis genes. We
  also uncover metabolism genes that have variable core classification depending
  on which allele is present. Our comparative pangenomics approach allows for
  detailed exploration of sequence type pangenomes within the context of the
  species. We show that pangenome evolution is independent of phylogenetic
  signal at the phylogroup level, which may be a consequence of distinct
  sequence type-specific driving factors relating to ecology and pathogenic
  phenotype.
