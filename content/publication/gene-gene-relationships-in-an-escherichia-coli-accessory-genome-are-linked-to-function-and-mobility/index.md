abstract: The pangenome contains all genes encoded by a species, with the core
  genome present in all strains and the accessory genome in only a subset.
  Coincident gene relationships are expected within the accessory genome, where
  the presence or absence of one gene is influenced by the presence or absence
  of another. Here, we analysed the accessory genome of an Escherichia coli
  pangenome consisting of 400 genomes from 20 sequence types to identify genes
  that display significant co-occurrence or avoidance patterns with one another.
  We present a complex network of genes that are either found together or that
  avoid one another more often than would be expected by chance, and show that
  these relationships vary by lineage. We demonstrate that genes co-occur by
  function, and that several highly connected gene relationships are linked to
  mobile genetic elements. We find that genes are more likely to co-occur with,
  rather than avoid, another gene in the accessory genome. This work furthers
  our understanding of the dynamic nature of prokaryote pangenomes and
  implicates both function and mobility as drivers of gene relationships.
