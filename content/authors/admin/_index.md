I'm Lilly, a 2nd year PhD student on [The Wellcome Trust - University of Nottingham & University of Birmingham Joint 4 Year PhD Training Programme for Antimicrobials & Antimicrobial Resistance](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/mds-graduate-school/wellcome-aamr/index.aspx). My research focuses on the evolution of multidrug resistance (MDR) in *Escherichia coli*, using a combination of bioinformatic and machine learning approaches to disentangle the evolutionary processes that can result in multidrug resistant phenotypes.

Beyond my research, I sit on my Institute's Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee. I am also part of the Microbiology Society's Early Career Microbiologists' Forum [Executive Committee](https://microbiologysociety.org/why-microbiology-matters/early-career-microbiologists-forum/meet-the-executive-committee.html) as the Audit, Risk, and Evalutation representative.
