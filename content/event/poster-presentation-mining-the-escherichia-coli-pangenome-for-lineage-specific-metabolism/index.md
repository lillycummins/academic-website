title: "Poster Presentation: Mining the Escherichia coli pangenome for
  lineage-specific metabolism"
abstract: _Escherichia coli_ is a diverse species spanning both common
  commensals of humans and animals and clinically important, major global
  pathogens. The metabolic capabilities of certain phenotypic groups can
  influence traits including colonisation, virulence and pathogenicity, but the
  extent to which these traits vary across lineages is unknown. To assess this,
  20,577 genomes were used to construct pangenomes for 21 distinct _E. coli_
  sequence types. Core metabolic networks were subsequently built for each
  lineage. Using these reconstructions, we uncovered huge, lineage-specific
  differences in the core metabolic profiles. We have identified a set of
  metabolic reactions that are uniquely present in each lineage, and a set that
  are uniquely absent, highlighting key genes of interest in the search for
  adaptations that are lineage- and environment-specific. Our results suggest
  that that variation in metabolic functions, deemed essential for the success
  of a lineage, will be key in future research to manipulate the abilities of
  specific _E. coli_ lineages in their relevant environments.
