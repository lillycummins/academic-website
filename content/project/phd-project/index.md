My PhD focuses on the differential evolution of resistance within *Escherichia coli.* Why do some lineages of *E. coli* possess multidrug resistance (MDR) whilst others do not? What factors created the right conditions to allow for the evolution of MDR in these lineages?  I am attempting to answer these questions with a combined approach of comparative pan-genomics, functional genomic analyses, and machine learning.

I am supervised by Professors [Alan McNally](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/microbiology-infection/mcnally-alan.aspx) and [James McInerney](http://mcinerneylab.com/james-mcinerney/) and funded by [The Wellcome Trust.](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/mds-graduate-school/wellcome-aamr/programme/programme.aspx)
