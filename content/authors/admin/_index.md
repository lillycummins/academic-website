I'm Lilly, a 2nd year PhD student on The Wellcome Trust - University of Nottingham & University of Birmingham Joint 4 Year PhD Training Programme for Antimicrobials & Antimicrobial Resistance. My research focuses on the evolution of multidrug resistance (MDR) in _Escherichia coli_, using a combination of bioinformatic and machine learning approaches to disentangle hte evolutionary processes that can result in multidrug resistant phenotypes.
