abstract: The Escherichia coli species exhibits a vast array of variable
  lifestyles, including environmental, commensal, and pathogenic organisms. Many
  of these E. coli contribute significantly to the global threat of
  antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) clones of E. coli
  have arisen multiple times over varying timescales. The repeated emergence of
  successful pandemic clones, including the notorious ST131 lineage, highlights
  a desperate need to further study the evolutionary processes underlying their
  emergence and success. Here, we review the evolutionary emergence of E. coli
  ST131 pandemic clones and draw parallels between their evolutionary
  trajectories and those of other lineages. From colonization and expansion to
  the acquisition of multidrug resistance plasmids, potentiating mutations are
  present at each stage, leading to a proposed sequence of events that may
  result in the formation of an antimicrobial-resistant pandemic clone.
