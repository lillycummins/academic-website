I'm Lilly, a postdoctoral researcher in the Sheppard Lab within the INEOS Oxford Institute of Antimicrobial Research and Departmen of Biology at the University of Oxford. I previously completed my PhD as part of the Wellcome Trust - University of Nottingham & University of Birmingham Joint 4 Year PhD Training Programme for Antimicrobials & Antimicrobial Resistance under the supervision of Professor Alan McNally and Dr. Nicole Wheeler. My research focuses on the evolution of multidrug resistance (MDR) in *Escherichia coli*, using a combination of comparative and functional genomic approaches to disentangle the evolutionary processes that can result in multidrug resistant phenotypes.

Beyond my research, I chair the Biology Research Staff Network Committee in my department and act as social media editor and editor mentee for [npj Antimicrobials and Resistance](https://www.nature.com/npjamar/). I am also part of the Microbiology Society's [Early Career Microbiologists' Forum Executive Committee](https://microbiologysociety.org/why-microbiology-matters/council-governance/committees/early-career-microbiologists-forum-committee.html?_gl=1*18733vw*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg1MzgxMjc1Ny4xNzIxMzA2NTA3*_ga_KJR7LS80P1*MTcyMTMwNjUwNi4xLjEuMTcyMTMwNjU0NS4wLjAuMA..) as the Publishing Panel representative and was previously elected as the Audit, Risk, and Evalutation representative.
