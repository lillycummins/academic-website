abstract: Prokaryote pangenomes are influenced heavily by environmental factors
  and the opportunity for gene gain and loss events. As the field of pangenome
  analysis has expanded, so has the need to fully understand the complexity of
  how eco-evolutionary dynamics shape pangenomes. Here, we describe current
  models of pangenome evolution and discuss their suitability and accuracy. We
  suggest that pangenomes are dynamic entities under constant flux, highlighting
  the influence of two-way interactions between pangenome and environment. New
  classifications of core and accessory genes are also considered, underscoring
  the need for continuous evaluation of nomenclature in a fast-moving field. We
  conclude that future models of pangenome evolution should incorporate
  eco-evolutionary dynamics to fully encompass their dynamic, changeable nature.
