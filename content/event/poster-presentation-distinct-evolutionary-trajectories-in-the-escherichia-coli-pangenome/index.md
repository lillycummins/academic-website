title: "Poster Presentation: Distinct evolutionary trajectories in the
  Escherichia coli pangenome"
abstract: Escherichia coli is a diverse species spanning both common commensals
  of humans and animals and clinically important, major global pathogens.
  Pangenomics can facilitate the understanding of the diversity within this
  species. Previous work on ST131 found allelic diversity in metabolism and
  colonisation genes that was linked to multidrug resistance. To develop this
  work further, we have examined E. coli as a whole species on a
  lineage-by-lineage basis. 20,577 genomes were used to construct pangenomes for
  21 distinct E. coli sequence types. We have identified sequence types enriched
  in metabolism genes, lineage-specific differences in core metabolic profiles,
  and lineage-specific alleles that may shed light on sequence type-specific
  metabolic adaptions that appear to evolve independently of phylogeny. These
  findings also provide evidence for differential evolution of metabolism genes.
  Our results suggest that selection and evolution of lineage-specific E. coli
  pangenomes may be happening in a non-phylogenetic manner and that sequence
  types are distinct in different ways. Further understanding of how these
  lineages differ will be key in future research to manipulate the abilities of
  specific E. coli lineages in their relevant environments.
